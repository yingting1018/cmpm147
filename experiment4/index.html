				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>We created 3 different worlds that symbolize our definition of "infinite". Through games, basic wallpapers, and something as well known as a piano, we replicated a never ending yet interactive world within our projects.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We utilized a lot of functions that we learned and implemented in our past experiments. We also took inspiration from the original examples, allowing users to create markers within the tiles. Specifically with the piano tile, we made it so users could only hit the black tiles in order for it to create different noises. Then for the 3rd world, we turned the market into a tree, so you could create your own world however you wanted to, making it feel personal but also creating life within the landscape.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Having three different worlds to brainstorm about was the hardest part, but once we got started it was fun to create the different ideas and see how the 3 of them have different aspects and ways that are considered "infinite" yet are so different.</p>
