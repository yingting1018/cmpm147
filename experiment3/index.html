					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This project generates a structure of an overworld, which is a green foresty terrain with cozy homes and lakes, and a dungeon map with different rooms, using auto tiling which allows the user to edit the tiles. We used the tileset created by Kacper Wozniak.
					</p>
	
		</div>

			<div class="square">
				<h2>Codes</h2>
				<p>For the overworld, using a dot (.) will edit the dark grass patches, w for the water, h for the house, underscore (_) for the light green patches of grass, and a T for the trees. For the dungeon we use a plus (+) for the background, d for the doors, and * for the gray room flooring. Furthermore, to move the slime monster we created, you can use WASD or the arrow keys.
					?</p>
			</div>

			<div class="square">
				<h2>Life</h2>
				<p>We created a slime sprite that is completely movable by the user by using WASD or the arrow keys. Furthermore, we have sparkles in the water, clouds that move across the y-axis as time goes by, and in the overworld it goes from day to night in a couple seconds. (using tiles from Micro Tileset - Overworld & Dungeon by thkaspar)

				</p>

			<div class="square">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>We felt like we put a lot of effort into both the overworld and the dungeon, and while there were other ideas we wanted to implement, we felt we couldn't because of both time and the restraints of the tilesheet provided. However, we enjoyed this project and believe we were able to add our own creative touches to it while following the requirements.</p>
